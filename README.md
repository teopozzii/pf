# Personal finance dashboard

This repository collects code to analyze personal income and consumption patterns, in order to raise awareness and reduce bias on spending habits, thereby developing stronger financial responsibility.

The `.gitignore` file avoids uploading data files as both for personal and others' use this is meant to remain private and confidential. On the other hand, the features of the code may be useful to a variety of users in different financial situations.

Current development is focused on automating data entry and categorization of expenditure items. This is done via keywords but can be augmented with AI.
