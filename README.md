# Personal finance

This repository collects code to analyze personal income and consumption patterns, in order to raise awareness and reduce bias on spending habits, thereby developing stronger financial responsibility.

The `.gitignore` file avoids uploading data files as both for personal and others' use this is meant to remain private and confidential. On the other hand, the features of the code may be useful to a variety of users in different financial situations.

A yet unresolved issue is that of performing data entry, especially for categorizing expenditure items (e.g. among leisure consumption, groceries, etc.). This may be soon automated via LLM tools, though at present I do not have the possibility to run such models locally without exposing personal data. Suggestions are appreciated.
